 A little Python script to help query Azure Log Analytics from the
 command line.

I've been doing some work with Azure Log Analytics lately and found the
__az__ tool lacking when it comes to querying Log Analytics.  So like anyone
who gets an itch and needs to scratch it, I decided to put something together
myself to help make it a bit easier for me.  So using Python and some awesome
modules I put together a little utility that could query Log Analytics and
provide it back in a few different formats.

## Problem
Query Log Analytics using the command line.  The query tool should allow input from
stdin so that KQL can be piped in to the command like a normal Unix utility.
Additionally, the format of the output should be configurable so you can get
return results in json, txt or csv
